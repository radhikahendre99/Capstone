Introduction: 
Loan Prediction Practice Problem.

This Notebook contains techniques and necessary skills to solve the problem.

This Notebook is divided into the following sections:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and PreProcessing.
Feature engineering and Model building
Problem Statement: 
A problem where we must predict whether a loan will be approved.


Goal: 
My goal is to use feature engineering to predict the target variable. 

Techniques: 
I divided data into training and validation. 70% of the data will be used for training the model and the rest of the 30% data will be used for checking validation of the model. Once data had been prepared, I built different models such as  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Random Forest with Grid Search, and XGBClassifier. 

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Data has 614 rows and 13 columns in the train dataset and 367 rows and 12 columns in the test dataset.

Visualizing the Data:
I used Bar plot, Box plot, and Heat map for visualization. 

Conclusion: 
Based on my findings 'Credit_History' and 'Balance Income' features are most important. So, feature engineering helped me in predicting my target variable.
